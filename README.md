# Give-Back
Ethereum Blockchain Dapp for running a secure and transparent charity

An Ethereum Dapp that allows charities with multiple (or single) missions/organizations to receive donations as ETH, where 
donors choose which missions they want to contribute to. 

The Smart Contract owner (i.e. charity) is given solitary access to distribute the donations accordingly, therefore providing
transparency and ensuring donors that their contributions are going straight to their specified organizations.
